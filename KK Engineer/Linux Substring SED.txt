This Challenge was easy find kind of tricky

the delete substring command was easy

sed '/change_sub/d' file.txt>file_delete.txt

now the replace was tricky because we only needed to
replace the lone word not words inside another word.
the solve was to put a space at first,because lone words will have a space to
specify that they are lone words and not words inside word

sed 's/ word/ change/g' BSD.txt>file_replace.txt
